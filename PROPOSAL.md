# Project Proposal

## Basic Premise

The main idea is to create an application that provides github users with chat rooms for repositories that they work with.

## Introduction

As I've worked in multiple projects on github, I've noticed quite a few different means of communications that people prefer. I've used separate applications such as Discord, Slack, and even Github's new built-in discussions page. However, for small projects that just need quick communications, there doesn't seem to be an easy, quick to setup and get everyone involved without needing to wait for some to create accounts and learn how to use the app.

My goal with this app is to provide a simple chat room, where contributors can discuss the project, organize production workflows, and reference issues or pull requests directly in the app. Additionally, contributors will be able to simply log into their Github Account instead of being required to set one up.

## Description

## User Stories

- As a user, I can sign in with my Github Account to sign into the app
- As a user, I can view a list of recent chat rooms to quickly get back to what I was working on
- As a user, I can tap a star on a chat room to pin it to the top of the list so I can keep chat rooms I want to keep on top
- As a user, I can select a chat room to open it up
- As a user, I can type and send a message into the chat room to interact with the conversation
- As a user, I can see chat messages appear quickly so I keep up with the conversation
- As a user, I can share a chat so I can invite friends into the chat
- As a user, I can create a new chat room for a repository that I own so I can coordinate with other contributors
- As a user, I can attach an issue or pull request to my message to reference
